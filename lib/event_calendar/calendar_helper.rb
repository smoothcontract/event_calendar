module EventCalendar
  module CalendarHelper

    # Returns an HTML calendar which can show multiple, overlapping events across calendar days and rows.
    # Customize using CSS, the below options, and by passing in a code block.
    #
    # The following are optional, available for customizing the default behaviour:
    # :month => Time.now.month # The month to show the calendar for. Defaults to current month.
    # :year => Time.now.year # The year to show the calendar for. Defaults to current year.
    # :dates => (start_date .. end_date) # Show specific range of days. Defaults to :year, :month.
    # :abbrev => true # Abbreviate day names. Reads from the abbr_day_names key in the localization file.
    # :first_day_of_week => 0 # Renders calendar starting on Sunday. Use 1 for Monday, and so on.
    # :show_today => true # Highlights today on the calendar using CSS class.
    # :show_header => true # Show the calendar's header. (month name, next, & previous links)
    # :month_name_text => nil # Displayed center in header row.
    #     Defaults to current month name from Date::MONTHNAMES hash.
    # :previous_month_text => nil # Displayed left of the month name if set
    # :next_month_text => nil # Displayed right of the month name if set
    # :event_strips => [] # An array of arrays, encapsulating the event rows on the calendar
    #
    # :width => nil # Width of the calendar, if none is set then it will stretch the container's width
    # :height => 500 # Approx minimum total height of the calendar (excluding the header).
    #     Height could get added if a day has too many event's to fit.
    # :day_names_height => 18 # Height of the day names table (included in the above 'height' option)
    # :day_nums_height => 18 # Height of the day numbers tables (included in the 'height' option)
    # :event_height => 18 # Height of an individual event row
    # :event_margin => 1 # Spacing of the event rows
    # :event_padding_top => 1 # Padding on the top of the event rows (increase to move text down)
    #
    # :use_all_day => false # If set to true, will check for an 'all_day' boolean field when displaying an event.
    #     If it is an all day event, or the event is multiple days, then it will display as usual.
    #     Otherwise it will display without a background color bar.
    # :use_javascript => true # Outputs HTML with inline javascript so events spanning multiple days will be highlighted.
    #     If this option is false, cleaner HTML will be output, but events spanning multiple days will
    #     not be highlighted correctly on hover, so it is only really useful if you know your calendar
    #     will only have single-day events. Defaults to true.
    # :link_to_day_action => false # If controller action is passed,
    #     the day number will be a link. Override the day_link method for greater customization.
    #
    # For more customization, you can pass a code block to this method
    # The varibles you have to work with in this block are passed in an agruments hash:
    # :event => The event to be displayed.
    # :day => The day the event is displayed on. Usually the first day of the event, or the first day of the week,
    #   if the event spans a calendar row.
    # :options => All the calendar options in use. (User defined and defaults merged.)
    #
    # For example usage, see README.
    #
